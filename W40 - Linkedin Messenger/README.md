## Week 40: LinkedIn Messenger (Runner Up Entry)

You’ve recently joined as the VP of Product at LinkedIn.
In your first weekly catch-up, the CPO tells you that engagement on messages on LinkedIn has
increased hugely and that LinkedIn is planning to create a separate messaging app. You’ve
been assigned the task of launching an MVP for the same.
Consider the following :-
● For the MVP, what are the features you’d consider launching with?
○ 2-3 line description for each feature of the MVP
○ Wireframe for the MVP (Figma/Balsamiq preferred)
● How would you market the value proposition to existing LinkedIn users?
○ What would be your Go-to-market strategy?
● What are the key metrics you’d measure for the MVP?


### Judging Criteria :-
1. Structure of the document
2. Strategic thought process
3. Usability of proposed features
4. Metrics thinking
5. Logical flow of wireframe
